For each serial print that you make, print the value of temperature, then a semicolon, then the value of luminance with a new line (use no whitespaces). You can do this by using three separate `Serial.print`, with the last one being a `Serial.println`. Print values 5 times per second (use the delay function to control this). Manually influence the readings of the sensors, by covering the photoresistor or shining light on it, and by lightly and carefully touching the temperature sensor to increase its temperature readings.\n",
